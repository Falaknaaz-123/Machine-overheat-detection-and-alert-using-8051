# Machine-overheat-detection-and-alert-using-8051 Microcontroller
This is an implementation of Machine overheat detection and alert using 8051 microcontrollers(Embedded systems).

Using 8051 microcontroller a unit was designed that can detect when the machine gets overheated and gives an indication of it via the LCD display.
